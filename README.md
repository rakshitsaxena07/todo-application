# 📝 ToDo Application – Backend (REST API)

This is a **backend-only ToDo (Task Management) application** built using **Node.js and Express**, following **MVC architecture**, **Clean Code principles**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

The application exposes a **RESTful API** that allows clients to create, read, update, filter, and delete tasks. No database is used — all data is stored **in-memory**, focusing purely on backend design and API flow.

---

## 🚀 Features

* RESTful API design
* MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture
* Clean separation of concerns
* In-memory data storage (no database)
* Proper HTTP status codes
* Validation using middleware
